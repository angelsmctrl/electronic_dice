# electronic_dice
This code is designed for the creation of an electronic dice adapted for people with disabilities
This project is based on an arduino nano that controls some leds (Ws2812b) and a buzzer generating a random number between 1 and 6 and showing it through a screen of 7 dice-shaped leds connected in series.
